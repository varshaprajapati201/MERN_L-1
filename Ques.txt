//Q4. A Sandwich Calculator
//1. Write a function called sandwich calculator. This should accept one value: bread
//2. The function should return the total number of possible sandwiches based on the amount of breads available. I need 2 breads to make one sandwich, so if there are 10 breads, it should return 5. Test your function with console.log.
//3. Extend your function so it accepts two values, bread and cheese.
//4. It takes two sbreads and one cheese to make a sandwich. The function should return the total number of possible sandwiches, so if there are breads, but only 1 cheese, it should return 1.
